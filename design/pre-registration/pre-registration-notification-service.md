# Approach for Notification Service

**Background**
- Exposing a REST API to send notifications to citizen via SMS or Email.

The key requirements are

-   Create a REST API to send notifications to citizen via SMS or Email, which internally calls the kernel notification service.

The key non-functional requirements are

-   Log : 
	- Log the each state while sending notification to a citizen:

-   Exception :
    -   Any exception occurred during sending notification, the same will be reported to the user with the user understandable exception.

**Solution**

**Notify :**

- Create a REST API as '/notify' POST method which accept the notification details, lang code, document for attachment as a request part parameters.
- notification details contains : name, pre-registration id, appointment date, appointment time, mobile number, email address and additionalRecipient.
- If the additionalRecipient is false then based on the pre-registration id do the REST call to retrieve the pre-registration data, parse the ID JSON object to get the mobile number and email address out of it.
- Do the REST call to retrieve the corresponding language notification templet based on requestd and lang code.
- DO the REST call to the KERNEL notification service based on SMS and Email. If it is successful send the success response otherwise throw an exception.

-----|----------|-------------|
PRG_ACK_001 |  Error   |   MOBILE_NUMBER_OR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_NOT_FILLED.
PRG_ACK_002 | Error | INCORRECT_MANDATORY_FIELDS.
